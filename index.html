    <p>
    I was born in South Brunswick, New Jersey. I moved to Ohio in 4th grade and
    have lived here until now. Fun fact, I also lived in California for a 
    year in 8th grade! I have two brothers, one younger, one older. I am 18 years old 
    and I am currently attending THE! Ohio State University, hoping to major in Computer 
    Science Engineering and maybe do a double major in math or statistics. In my free time, I love to play 
    guitar, video games, and sports. I hope to see you around campus and go bucks!!
